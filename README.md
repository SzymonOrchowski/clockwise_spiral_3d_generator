# clockwise_spiral_3d_generator

A project made by Szymon Orchowski in three.js, inspired by a kata by alex.budiakov.

This simple project comes up as a side result of my everyday coding practice. During solving one of Codewars's kata titled: The Clockwise Spiral I decided to code a visual presentation of a final algorithm.
Here is an original kata description:

> Your objective is to complete a function createSpiral(N) that receives an integer N and returns an NxN two-dimensional array with numbers 1 through NxN represented as a clockwise spiral.

<h2>Instructions:</h2>

Just choose a value of N on a slider on the top-right (number of objects per side) and click generate!

You can check results from a different perspective. Use the left mouse button to rotate and scroll to zoom in / zoom out.


<h3>Have fun!</h3>
